# Engineering
A collection of coding projects I made during my senior year in Engineering class.

**Calculator:** Calculates results for inputted expressions and displays result in LaTeX.

**CelticKnot:** Interactive Celtic Knot generator. User can modify the base Celtic Knot to create all sorts of variations.

**Chess:** An implementation of the game of Chess with only the basic rules. Rules like castling and en passant were left for later versions.

**Geometry Dash Level Creator:** Allows creation of levels to be used in the Geometry Dash game above.

**LightsOut:** Implementation of the well known Lights Out game with the ability to look at solutions or have an AI solve the given puzzle.

**Physics:** Final Physics paper. Problem, Final Paper, and code (physics.py) are all given in the folder.

**Physics Lab:** An interactive physics lab simulator that challenges students to calculate the spring constant of a virtual spring.

**Physics Problem:** Solution to Momentum Problem (given in folder). Doesn't implement the increasing length of the string from the problem.

**PixelArt:** Pixel Art gif

**PixelArtPython:** Generates the javascript code for the Pixel Art gif created above.

**Snake:** Implementation of the classic game of Snake. The snake is rainbow colored as per Samantha's request.

**SummerWebsite:** Website created during the beginning of the course to present past experience with code.
