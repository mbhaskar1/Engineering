            This is a project I'm currently working on. I'm using a genetic algorithm along with a neural network to attempt to
            evolve up to a snake that can play the game snake well. I am training it on a neural network that takes the relative position
            of the food and the distance to danger in the 3 directions around the snake's head. The idea of the genetic algorithm is I
            start off by creating 100 random snakes, and then I take the top 50 and then use genetic crossover methods along with mutations
            to create 50 new snakes. I then continue repeating this for as many generations as I want. The "fitness function" I used to 
            determine which snakes fell into the top 50 was a function that added the total number of different tiles visited to 100 times
            the amount of food collected. In it's current state, the best snake my genetic algorithm was able to produce was a snake that
            was able to survive by going in circles and collect food that wasn't too close to the wall. To improve on this, in the future I'm
            planning on adding more inputs and modifying the fitness function such that it gives points for getting closer to the food and takes
            away 1.5 times that amount of points for getting farther from the food.
