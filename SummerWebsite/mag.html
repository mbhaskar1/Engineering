            The Mondrian Art Generator was a small project I worked on while taking AP Computer Science A online during the summer. There was
            an lesson where we were learning about the concept of recursion and we were learning about Mondrian Art which incorporated many of
            the ideas of recursion. In the assignment for that lesson we were told to use a graphics drawing program of our choice or an online
            Mondrian Art Generator to create an example of Mondrian Art and then answer some discussion questions based on it. I was really bored
            that day, so I decided to make my own graphics drawing program to draw the Mondrian Art for the assignment. This program is the result
            of this.

            For this program I created a rectangle class that stored two points (used to define a rectangle) and a color. I then created a list of
            rectangles, which I initialized to have one single white rectangle that covered the whole screen. I then added functionality such that
            when the user pressed the mouse button, based on the mode that was currently selected, the program would take the rectangle that was clicked
            on and split it into two new rectangles. The original rectangle would then be removed from the list, and the two new rectangles would be
            appended.
