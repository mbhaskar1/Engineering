            Recursive Tic Tac Toe is an interesting variant of tic tac toe. The rules are the same with the one twist being that when an opponent makes a move,
            you have the option to challenge that move. Challenging a move replaces that move with another tic tac toe board, and passes the turn back to the
            oppponent. The opponent will then be forced to play inside that new tic tac toe board. Once the opponent's turn is over, the game will continue with
            both players being able to play on the entire board. If a player wins a game on a smaller board, that board will be replaced with their piece. If a
            smaller board is tied, that board will be replaced with an empty spot that anyone can play on. And that's basically it; whoever gets 3 pieces in a row
            on the main board wins the game.

            This game has been published to both the Google Play Store and the iOS App Store, and I've gotten over 100 total installs across both platforms.

            One of my biggest accomplishments in this game was creating a full fledged AI that players can play against. I used the Monte Carlo Tree Search
            Algorithm, one of the algorithms used as the base for Google's Deep Mind, to allow the AI to pick the best move it could identify within a
            reasonable amount of time. In the game, I created varying difficulties for the AI by restricting this allowed time to different amounts.

            Another feature I'm proud of in this game is the multiplayer functionality. I utilized the GameSparks back-end service to allow for turn based
            gameplay between two devices. There are three modes in multiplayer: Ranked, Unranked, and With Friend. In ranked, you are placed against a players
            with similar ability to yours based on your ELO ranking. If you win the game, your ELO rises, and if you lose, your ELO drops. Unranked
            places you with a random player that is also queueing for an unranked match at the same time. Finally, With Friend allows you to create a game with
            a random join code, and allow your friend to join that game by using that code.
